# Dynamic QR Codes
Simple application to use qr codes dynamically using express &amp; nodejs. This is a project for my Residential Education floor as I am a Resident Assistant.

Basically you setup some qr codes that point to static urls. However, these static URLs lead to this application that basically acts as the middleman before redirecting to the specific URL. Therefore you can update the URL of the qr code at any time with the same static QR code.
